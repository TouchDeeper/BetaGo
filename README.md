## Dependencies
- moveit-ros packages:
```
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-moveit-ros-*
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-moveit
```
- ridgeback packages:
```
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-ridgeback*
```
- UR5 packages:
```
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-ur-*
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-ur5*
```

- [td_ros](https://github.com/TouchDeeper/td_ros):

we add the td_ros directly by submodule.

- [TdLib](https://github.com/TouchDeeper/TdLib):

modify all the `TdLib_DIR` in the CMakeLists.txt to your case.

## Usage
create the workspace

`mkdir ~/BetaGo_ws && cd ~/BetaGo_ws`

clone this repositories and build

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:TouchDeeper/BetaGo.git src/
catkin_make
```
Possible problem: 
1. 
 ```
  catkin_package() include dir 'include' does not exist relative to
    '[package_path]'
  ```
   - solution: add `include` directory in the `[package_path]`
2. `No rule to make target '/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libproj.so`
    - solution: `sudo ln -s  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libproj.so.9 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libproj.so`
### Simulation
- ur5 and allegro_hand are imported by environment variable RIDGEBACK_URDF_EXTRAS. RIDGEBACK_URDF_EXTRAS = your workspace path/src/betago_description/urdf/betago/ridgeback_urdf_extras.xacro
     - method1: set temporary environment variable:`export RIDGEBACK_URDF_EXTRAS=~/BetaGo_ws/src/betago_description/urdf/betago/ridgeback_urdf_extras.xacro`
    - method2: set permanent environment variable:
        1. terminal:`sudo gedit ~/.bashrc`
        2. add `export RIDGEBACK_URDF_EXTRAS=~/BetaGo_ws/src/betago_description/urdf/betago/ridgeback_urdf_extras.xacro` in the end.
        3. terminal:`source ~/.bashrc`
        
- Check if the model has been downloaded in `~/.Gazebo/`, if not, you need to download the model first and put it in `~/.Gazebo/`. [Download link](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo_models/downloads/).
For Chinese, download from [rosclub.cn](http://www.rosclub.cn/post-37.html) : link: http://pan.baidu.com/s/1pKaeg0F, password:cmxc
    - set GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH:
        1. terminal:`sudo gedit ~/.bashrc`
        2. add `export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH="/home/wang/.gazebo/models"` in the end.
        3. terminal:`source ~/.bashrc`
### Real robot
#### Step to connect to the ridgeback by wired connection

1. plug in the network cable.
2. start the ridgeback, then push the E-STOP to release the lock. 
3. set the wired connection in your desktop, see the [gif](https://github.com/TouchDeeper/BetaGo/blob/ztd/media/set_wire_network.gif).
4. add the config in the below to your ~/.bashrc, and `source ~/.bashrc`
```
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.131.1:11311 #Ethernet
export ROS_IP=192.168.131.100
```
5.add the config `192.168.131.1 CPR-R100-0057`in the below to your /etc/hosts, the location is after the line like 
```
127.0.0.1	localhost
127.0.1.1	[your-computer-name]
```
6.`rostopic list` in your desktop to see if the topics in the ridgeback have been send to your desktop. If receive the topic, the connection is valid.
#### Step to connect to the ridgeback by wireless network
1. connect the ridgeback's computer and your pc to the same Local Area Network.
2. get the IP of ridgeback by `ifconfig -a` in ridgeback's computer. The IP is in the `wlp3s0` item, and the sentence is `inet addr:[IP_ridgeback]`. 
3. get the IP of your pc by 'ifconfig -a' in you pc. The IP is in the `wlo1` item, and the sentence is `inet addr:[IP_pc]`. 
4. comment out the config code for wire connection. And add the config in the below to your ~/.bashrc, and `source ~/.bashrc`
   ```
   export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://[IP_ridgeback]:11311 #Ethernet
   export ROS_IP=[IP_pc]
   ```
5. add the config `[IP_ridgeback] CPR-R100-0057`in the below to your /etc/hosts, the location is after the line like 
   ```
   127.0.0.1	localhost
   127.0.1.1	[your-computer-name]
   ```
6.`rostopic list` in your desktop to see if the topics in the ridgeback have been send to your desktop. If receive the topic, the connection is valid.
7. note!!!: after connection with ridgeback's computer, if your pc also need to run ros, comment out the content added in step 4 and 5 and re-source.
### step to login the ridgeback's pc by ssh
1. `ssh administrator@[IP_ridgeback]`
### Step to run the package
- ur5 and allegro_hand are imported by environment variable RIDGEBACK_URDF_EXTRAS. RIDGEBACK_URDF_EXTRAS = your workspace path/src/betago_description/urdf/betago/ridgeback_urdf_extras.xacro
     - method1: set temporary environment variable:`export RIDGEBACK_URDF_EXTRAS=your workspace path/src/betago_description/urdf/betago/ridgeback_urdf_extras.xacro`
    - method2: set permanent environment variable:
        1. terminal:`sudo gedit ~/.bashrc`
        2. add `export RIDGEBACK_URDF_EXTRAS="your workspace path/src/betago_description/urdf/betago/ridgeback_urdf_extras.xacro"` in the end.
        3. terminal:`source ~/.bashrc`
