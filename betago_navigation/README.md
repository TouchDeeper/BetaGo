# Navigation Package for BetaGo 
This is navigation package for BetaGo.
We just use the navigation package of ridgeback now. But don't forget to export the environment variable.

## Step to run the package
- read the navigation [tutorial](http://www.clearpathrobotics.com/assets/guides/ridgeback/navigation.html) of the ridgeback
- change `roslaunch ridgeback_gazebo ridgeback_world.launch` to `roslaunch betago_gazebo betago_world.launch`
- The rest is the same as the tutorial said.
